Step 1: Open Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio on your computer.
Open your project in Visual Studio.

Step 2: Set Up Your Project
Ensure your project is set up correctly. Your files (like Main, Ingredients, Steps, Recipe, and User) should be part of the project.
The main method should be in a file typically named Program.cs in the root of your project.

Step 3: Build Your Project
In the Solution Explorer panel (usually on the right side), make sure your project is selected.
To compile (build) your project, go to the Build menu at the top of Visual Studio and select Build Solution.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut F6 to build the solution.
Visual Studio will compile your project and check for any errors. If there are no errors, the build will be successful.

Step 4: Run Your Program
After building your project successfully, you can run your program.
Go to the Debug menu at the top of Visual Studio and select Start Debugging.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut F5 to start debugging.
This will execute your program, starting with the Main method, and you will see the console output in a new window.

Step 5: Use the App
The console window will prompt you to enter user details, and then you can proceed to enter recipes, ingredients, and steps.
Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts to use the app.

Step 6: Exit the App
To exit the app, follow the app's instructions (usually an option such as entering a specific number to exit).
The console window will close automatically when the app is finished running.

Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any errors during the build, Visual Studio will show you the details in the Error List panel, and you will need to fix them before running the program.
If you encounter runtime errors, the Output panel and Debugging tools can help you diagnose the issue.
